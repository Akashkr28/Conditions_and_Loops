Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

Ans: - Conditional statements in programming are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions being met or not. In JavaScript, there are 	primarily three types of conditional statements: if, else if, and else. Here's a breakdown of each:

	1. if statement: - It is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true.
	
	- Syntax:
		if (condition) {
    			// block of code to be executed if the condition is true
		}

	- Example:
		let x = 10;
		if (x > 5) {
    			console.log("x is greater than 5");
		}

	2. else if statement: - It is used to specify a new conditions if the first condition is false.

	- Syntax:
		if (condition1) {
    			// block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
		} else if (condition2) {
    			// block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
		}

	- Example:
		let time = 20;
		if (time < 12) {
    			console.log("Good morning!");
		} else if (time < 18) {
    			console.log("Good afternoon!");
		}

	3. else statement: - It is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the "if" statement evaluates to false.

	- Syntax:
		if (condition) {
    			// block of code to be executed if the condition is true
		} else {
    			// block of code to be executed if the condition is false
		}
	
	- Example:
		let num = -5;
		if (num >= 0) {
    			console.log("Number is positive");
		} else {
    			console.log("Number is negative");
		}
