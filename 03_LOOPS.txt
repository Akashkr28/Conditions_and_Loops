Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

Ans:- 
	Loops in programming are control structures that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. They are used when you want to perform a 	task multiple times without writing the same code over and over again. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of 	data.

	There are mainly three types of loops in JavaScript:

	1. for loop: It repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

   	- Syntax:
 
   	for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
       		// block of code to be executed
   	}

   	- Example:
 
   	for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
       		console.log(i);
   	}

	2. while loop: It repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true.

   	- Syntax:

   	while (condition) {
       		// block of code to be executed
       		// condition update
   	}

   	- Example:

   	let i = 0;
   	while (i < 5) {
       		console.log(i);
       		i++;
   	}

	3. do while loop: It is similar to a while loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once, even if the condition is false.

   	- Syntax:

   	do {
       		// block of code to be executed
       		// condition update
   	} while (condition);

   	- Example:

   	let i = 0;
   	do {
       		console.log(i);
       		i++;
   	} while (i < 5);

	Each type of loop serves a specific purpose, and the choice of which one to use depends on the situation and the specific requirements of your code. They allow 	you to iterate over arrays, manipulate data, and perform various other tasks efficiently.
